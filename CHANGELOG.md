## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.5] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed
- **Context-Aware Mentor**: Fixed vibe_check_mentor providing generic advice on completion reports (Issue #167)
  - Added BusinessContextExtractor for intelligent context detection
  - Implemented clarifying questions for low/medium confidence scenarios
  - Added negative indicators to prevent false positive pattern triggers
  - Reordered processing to analyze context before patterns
  - Added ConfidenceThresholds constants and comprehensive error handling

## [0.4.0] - 2025-06-19

### Added
- **Complete Strategy Pattern Architecture**: Configuration-driven response system replacing 375+ lines of hardcoded logic
- **Enhanced 2025 Technology Support**: Comprehensive LLM pricing, framework comparisons, and AI tool recommendations
- **YAML Configuration System**: All technology patterns and pricing data externalized to `tech_patterns.yaml`
- **Budget LLM Support**: DeepSeek R1 ($0.14/$2.19), GPT-4.1 nano ($0.075/$0.30), Claude 3.5 Haiku, Llama 4
- **Framework Comparisons**: Astro vs Next.js, Bun vs Node.js, LangChain vs LlamaIndex with specific use case advice
- **Database Rankings**: Vector DBs (Milvus > Weaviate ≈ Qdrant) and Graph DBs (FalkorDB vs Neo4j) with performance data
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 18 pytest tests with performance regression detection

### Changed  
- **MAJOR REFACTORING**: 413-line `generate_senior_engineer_response` method reduced to 25 lines using strategy pattern
- **File Size Reduction**: `vibe_mentor_enhanced.py` reduced from 1000+ lines to 588 lines (-40%)
- **Architecture**: Response generation centralized in priority-based strategy pattern
- **Configuration Management**: Singleton config loader with staleness detection and fallback handling
- **Constants**: Added `MAX_FEATURES=5`, `MAX_DECISION_POINTS=3` replacing magic numbers

### Fixed
- **Performance**: O(n*m) → O(1) pattern matching with compiled regex patterns  
- **Security**: ReDoS attack prevention with input validation and length limits
- **Code Quality**: All of Claude's code review issues addressed (duplicate logic, magic numbers, method complexity)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with meaningful fallback responses

### Performance
- **Context Extraction**: < 0.1s for large input processing
- **Strategy Selection**: < 0.5s for 1000 response generations
- **Pattern Matching**: LRU cache with compiled regex for O(1) lookup performance

### Technical Debt Eliminated
- Removed duplicate LLM comparison logic scattered across multiple methods
- Eliminated hardcoded responses (lines 356-649) in favor of configuration
- Consolidated helper methods (`_handle_llm_comparisons`, `_handle_framework_comparisons`) into strategy pattern
- Fixed all magic numbers with proper constants

### Testing
- Added comprehensive unit tests for strategy pattern components
- Performance regression tests to prevent O(n*m) issues
- Integration tests for end-to-end query flows
- Fallback configuration testing for error resilience
