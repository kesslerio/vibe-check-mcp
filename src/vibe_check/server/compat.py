    """Allow older clients that send ``"initialized"`` notifications.

    Codex CLI (versions â‰¤0.48) emits the pre-1.0 MCP notification method value
    ``"initialized"`` instead of the spec-compliant ``"notifications/initialized"``
    during the handshake. The upstream ``mcp`` package enforces the Literal constraint,
    so the legacy value is rejected before FastMCP can complete initialization.

    This function patches the Pydantic field annotation at runtime to accept both
    method values, ensuring compatibility during the Codex transition period.

    Returns:
        ``True`` if the patch was applied, ``False`` when already compatible or patched.
