    ðŸ§  Senior engineer collaborative reasoning - Get multi-perspective feedback on technical decisions.

    Interactive senior engineer mentor combining vibe-check pattern detection with collaborative reasoning.
    Multiple engineering personas analyze your technical decisions and provide structured feedback.

    Features:
    - ðŸ§  Multi-persona collaborative reasoning (Senior, Product, AI/ML Engineer perspectives)
    - ðŸŽ¯ Automatic anti-pattern detection drives persona responses
    - ðŸ’¬ Session continuity for multi-turn conversations  
    - ðŸ“Š Structured insights with consensus and disagreements
    - ðŸŽ“ Educational coaching recommendations
    - âš¡ NEW: Interrupt mode for quick focused interventions

    Modes:
    - interrupt: Quick focused intervention (<3 seconds) - single question/approval
    - standard: Normal collaborative reasoning with selected personas
    - comprehensive: Full analysis (legacy, same as reasoning_depth="comprehensive")

    Reasoning Depths (when mode="standard"):
    - quick: Senior engineer perspective only
    - standard: Senior + Product engineer perspectives  
    - comprehensive: All personas with full collaborative reasoning

    Use this tool for: "Should I build a custom auth system?", "Planning microservices architecture", 
    "What's the best approach for API integration?", "Continue previous discussion about caching"

    Args:
        query: Technical question or decision to discuss
        context: Additional context (code, architecture, requirements)
        session_id: Session ID to continue previous conversation
        reasoning_depth: Analysis depth - quick/standard/comprehensive (default: standard)
        continue_session: Whether to continue existing session (default: false)
        mode: Interaction mode - interrupt/standard (default: standard)
        phase: Development phase - planning/implementation/review (default: planning)
        confidence_threshold: Minimum confidence to trigger interrupt (default: 0.7)
        file_paths: Optional list of file paths to analyze (max 10 files, 1MB each)
        working_directory: Optional working directory for resolving relative paths
        
    Returns:
        Collaborative reasoning analysis with multi-perspective insights or quick interrupt
