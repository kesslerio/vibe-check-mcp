    üöÄ Fast Integration Pattern Detection for Vibe Coding Safety Net.
    
    Real-time detection of integration anti-patterns to prevent engineering disasters
    like the Cognee case study. Provides instant feedback on technology usage and
    custom development decisions with sub-second response for development workflow.
    
    Features:
    - üîç Technology Recognition: Instant detection of Cognee, Supabase, OpenAI, Claude
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Red Flag Detection: Custom development when official alternatives exist
    - üìä Effort Analysis: High line counts for standard integrations
    - üí° Immediate Recommendations: Official alternatives and next steps
