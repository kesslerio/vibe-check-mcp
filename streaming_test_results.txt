MCP STREAMING TEST RESULTS
========================================

Streaming Supported: NO

Details:
- FastMCP Context.sample() returns a complete response object
- No streaming parameters in method signature
- MCP protocol supports streaming in spec but FastMCP doesn't implement it yet
- Would need transport-level changes (WebSocket/SSE) for true streaming

Recommendation: Proceed without streaming for now, revisit when FastMCP adds support
