# 🧭 Vibe Check MCP

**Your AI coding safety net with senior engineer collaborative reasoning - because getting 90% done and then stuck for weeks sucks.**

Vibe Check MCP v0.4.4 stops you from building yourself into a corner with AI-generated code. It's like having a **team of senior engineers** watching over your shoulder, ready to **interrupt bad decisions in real-time** and catch expensive mistakes before you waste days on unfixable problems.

## 🧠 Senior Engineer Collaborative Reasoning

**The game-changing feature that actually prevents disasters before they happen:**

### 🚨 **Interrupt Mode - Stop Bad Decisions Mid-Sentence**
```bash
❌ You: "I'll build a custom HTTP client for this API"
✅ Mentor: "Have you checked if an official SDK exists?" (INTERRUPT!)
```

**This literally stops you when you're about to make expensive mistakes.** It's like having a senior engineer tap you on the shoulder and say "Hey, wait a minute..."

### 🤝 **Multi-Persona Collaborative Reasoning**
Get feedback from **multiple engineering perspectives simultaneously**:
- 👨‍💻 **Senior Engineer**: "This looks like premature optimization"
- 📋 **Product Manager**: "Does this actually solve the user problem?"
- 🤖 **AI/ML Engineer**: "There's a simpler approach using existing models"

### 🎯 **Real Disasters This Prevents:**
- Building custom auth systems when Auth0 exists
- Creating REST APIs when GraphQL endpoints are available
- Writing complex parsers when libraries handle it
- **The Cognee Case Study**: Prevented 2+ weeks of custom development when official Docker containers existed

> **Built for Claude Code MCP Integration** - Seamlessly integrates with your existing Claude Code workflow for real-time engineering coaching.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

**Ever spend weeks building something, only to discover there was a simple API call for that?**

You're not alone. Vibe Check is specifically designed for **vibe coders** - people who love AI coding tools but need a sanity check to avoid the overengineering traps that AI often creates.

### **If These Sound Familiar:**

🔥 **"I spent $417 using Claude to build a word game, only to discover my AI-generated code had no server-side validation - it got DDOS'd with the entire Bee Movie script"**   
🔥 **"LLM coded an entire iOS app database in a CSV file instead of Core Data - I had no idea!"**  
🔥 **"Just plug the error back into ChatGPT until the code it generates oscillates between two error states forever"** 
🔥 **"People are already losing touch with what the code they are writing is actually doing. AI can help get code out the door faster, but when it breaks it can be a lot harder to debug and fix"** 

### **You're Our Target User If You:**

- **🎮 Love AI Coding Tools** - Use Claude, Cursor, Copilot but sometimes wonder if the suggestions are overengineered
- **🤔 Trust But Want To Verify** - Get excited about AI solutions but lack deep library knowledge to validate them
- **🔄 Stuck in Doom Loops** - Experience cycles where each AI fix creates new problems  
- **📚 Don't Review Code Like Pros** - Accept AI suggestions without deep technical review (that's totally normal!)
- **⚡ Value Speed Over Perfection** - Prefer working solutions over architecturally perfect ones

### **Your Real Pain Points:**
- **Security Blindspots**: AI confidently generates code missing critical validations (like the $417 game that got hacked)
- **Doom Loop Oscillation**: Code changes bounce between error states endlessly, wasting hours
- **Outdated Solutions**: AI suggests deprecated practices instead of current best approaches
- **Loss of Understanding**: AI writes code you can't debug when it inevitably breaks
- **Mixed Language Syntax**: AI imports Go libraries in Rust code or other nonsensical combinations
- **Overconfident Wrong Answers**: AI sounds authoritative about completely incorrect information

**Vibe Check MCP is your AI coding safety net - keeping the fun of vibe coding while avoiding the expensive traps.**
