Vibe Check MCP ENGINEERING GUIDELINES

CORE DOCUMENTS:
- Technical Implementation Guide: docs/TECHNICAL.md (architecture, validation results, roadmap)
- Product Requirements Document: docs/PRD.md (vision, requirements, success metrics)
- Claude Code CLI Usage: docs/api/CLAUDE_CODE_CLI_USAGE.md (standard CLI patterns, MCP integration)
- Claude Code SDK: docs/api/CLAUDE_CODE_SDK.md (programmatic integration, output formats)

DOCUMENTATION-FIRST RULE:
Before ANY custom third-party integration:
1. Check official documentation for standard approach
2. Research existing solutions online
3. Test documented standard approach first
4. Build custom only if standard demonstrably fails
5. Document WHY standard is insufficient

RESEARCH HIERARCHY:
1. Official documentation
2. Online solutions (GitHub, Stack Overflow)
3. Third-party alternatives
4. Build custom (last resort)

COMPLEXITY AUDIT CHECKLIST:
When encountering existing complex code:
- QUESTION if complexity is necessary
- VERIFY if official documentation suggests simpler approach
- TEST if standard APIs achieve same result
- Use mcp__clear-thought-server__mentalmodel(First Principles) for analysis

ENGINEERING RED FLAGS (Stop and reassess):
- Building workarounds for third-party bugs instead of using different APIs
- Spending >2 hours without checking official docs
- Assuming complex code is necessary without testing alternatives
- Continuing investment due to sunk cost fallacy

THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATION PROTOCOL:
Phase 1: Research & Validation
- Review standard docs for simplest API patterns
- Create minimal POC with real data
- Use mcp__clear-thought-server__mentalmodel(First Principles) if complex
Phase 2: Implementation (only if POC proves standard insufficient)
- Use mcp__clear-thought-server__decisionframework(Standard vs Custom Integration)
- Handle bugs by avoiding buggy code paths (DEFAULT behavior)
- Document rationale in ADR

FORBIDDEN PATTERNS:
- Custom HTTP clients when SDKs exist
- Infrastructure-first without API validation
- Symptom fixes without root cause analysis
- Complex workarounds for API misunderstanding

ENGINEERING CHECKLIST:
- Verify problem understanding (First Principles if complex)
- Confirm official docs checked
- Research existing solutions
- Audit complexity of existing code
- Plan for modularity (files <700 lines, functions <50 lines)
- Consider scalability/maintainability impact

ANTI-PATTERN COACH DEVELOPMENT:

CLAUDE CODE INTEGRATION:
- CLI-first architecture with Claude Code compatibility (docs/api/CLAUDE_CODE_CLI_USAGE.md)
- SDK patterns for programmatic integration (docs/api/CLAUDE_CODE_SDK.md)
- Educational anti-pattern prevention focus
- Export patterns in Claude Code compatible format

CLI PRINCIPLES:
- Click framework for enterprise patterns
- Single responsibility per command
- Early input validation with clear errors
- Structured educational output
- Type hints for all parameters
- Clear tool descriptions

DETECTION ARCHITECTURE:
- AST parsing for sophisticated analysis
- Regex for quick pattern matching
- Leverage existing tools (pylint, mypy, bandit)
- JSON/YAML knowledge base
- Extensible pattern system

BUILD/TEST COMMANDS:
- Install: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run server: PYTHONPATH=src python -m vibe_check server
- Test: pytest
- Coverage: pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
- Type check: mypy src/
- Lint: pylint src/
- Security: bandit -r src/
- Format: black src/ tests/
- Imports: isort src/ tests/

VERSIONING SYSTEM:
- Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH): https://semver.org/
- Version source of truth: VERSION file in project root
- Centralized version utilities: src/vibe_check/utils/version_utils.py
- Release script: scripts/release.sh (automated version management)

VERSION POLICIES:
- MAJOR: Breaking changes, API incompatibilities (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
- MINOR: New features, backward compatible (0.1.0 -> 0.2.0)
- PATCH: Bug fixes, no new features (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1)
- Pre-release: Alpha/Beta versions (0.1.0-alpha.1, 0.1.0-beta.1)

RELEASE PROCESS:
1. Ensure main branch is clean and up-to-date
2. Run full test suite: pytest
3. Run release script: ./scripts/release.sh
4. Select release type (major/minor/patch)
5. Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
6. Script handles version bump, tagging, and GitHub release

VERSION COMMANDS:
- Check current: python -c "from vibe_check import __version__; print(__version__)"
- Validate version: python -c "from vibe_check.utils.version_utils import parse_semantic_version; parse_semantic_version('1.2.3')"
- Compare versions: python -c "from vibe_check.utils.version_utils import compare_versions; print(compare_versions('1.2.3', '1.2.4'))"

CHANGELOG REQUIREMENTS:
- Follow Keep a Changelog format: https://keepachangelog.com/
- Categorize changes: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
- Link versions to GitHub releases
- Include migration notes for breaking changes

CODE PRINCIPLES:
- Python: Strict typing, prefer functions over classes
- FastMCP: Use decorators, structured error responses
- Config: Environment variables, no hardcoded secrets, .env support
- Errors: Specific try/catch with detailed messages
- Logging: Python logging with correlation IDs
- Temporary Files: ALWAYS use /tmp/, NEVER in project directories

CODE STYLE:
- PEP 8 with Black (88 char lines)
- Functions <40 lines (SRP)
- PascalCase (classes), snake_case (functions/vars), UPPER_CASE (constants)
- Type hints mandatory, docstrings for public functions
- Standard -> Third-party -> Local imports

TESTING:
- ALL tests in /tests directory
- pytest with test_*.py naming
- Use pytest fixtures and @pytest.mark.asyncio
- Integration tests: @pytest.mark.integration
- Clean up resources, skip if dependencies unavailable

MCP TOOL SCHEMAS:
- NEVER use oneOf/allOf/anyOf at root level
- Handle either/or validation in runtime code
- Clear parameter names and descriptions
- Include examples in descriptions

MCP TOOL RESPONSE HANDLING:
- When MCP tools return "comment_url" or "user_message" fields, ALWAYS include the full GitHub URL in your response to help users access posted comments/reviews directly
- Don't summarize GitHub URLs - show them explicitly so users can click through

GITHUB WORKFLOW:

CRITICAL: Create PRs to your own repository unless told otherwise

NAMING CONVENTION:
Tools follow `action_what.py` pattern:
- analyze_issue.py, analyze_text.py
- review_pr.py, review_issue.py, review_code.py

Makes tool discovery intuitive.

PREFERRED MCP APPROACH:
Use GitHub MCP server for comprehensive GitHub operations with natural language commands for PR creation, issue management

FALLBACK COMMANDS (if MCP unavailable):
git checkout -b feature/<name> && git add . && git commit -m "Feature: <desc>" && git push -u origin HEAD && gh pr create -t "Feature: <desc>" -b "<details>"

PR REVIEW PROCESS:

When asked to "check PR review" or similar:
1. FETCH PR COMMENTS: Use GitHub MCP server natural language queries like "show comments on PR <NUMBER> by kesslerio"
2. CHECK EXISTING ISSUES: Search for existing issues that might already address recommendations to avoid duplicates
3. SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS: Use mcp__clear-thought-server__decisionframework for each review item:
   - "PR Review Item Evaluation"
   - Options: ["Fix in current PR", "Create follow-up issue", "Nice-to-have (ignore)", "Overengineering concern"]
   - Analysis Type: "Engineering Decision"
4. CATEGORIZE FEEDBACK WITH CLEAR RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - CRITICAL (blocking): ⚠️ Must fix in current PR before merging
   - IMPORTANT (actionable): 📋 Could create follow-up issue (if not already exists)
   - NICE-TO-HAVE (optional): 💡 Consider but likely YAGNI
   - OVERENGINEERING (reject): ❌ Adds unnecessary complexity
5. COMMUNICATE CLEARLY: Include specific action recommendation in review response
6. ADDRESS ISSUES: Fix only critical blocking issues in current PR
7. CREATE FOLLOW-UP ISSUES: Only if genuinely valuable and not already tracked
8. UPDATE PR: Commit and push critical fixes only
9. FINAL UPDATE: If PR was changed due to review feedback, add comment summarizing what was addressed
10. MERGE PR: Use GitHub MCP server merge functionality
11. CLEAN UP: Delete feature branch after merge

DECISION FRAMEWORK FOR PR FEEDBACK:
Use Clear-Thought decision framework to evaluate each review item:

CRITERIA FOR "FIX IN CURRENT PR":
- Blocks merge (missing issue linkage, breaking functionality)
- Security vulnerabilities or critical bugs
- Simple fixes that don't change scope

CRITERIA FOR "CREATE FOLLOW-UP ISSUE":
- Good ideas that expand scope beyond current PR
- Performance improvements that require analysis
- Documentation enhancements not critical to current functionality
- Refactoring suggestions that don't affect core functionality

CRITERIA FOR "NICE-TO-HAVE (IGNORE)":
- Subjective style preferences already covered by linting
- Minor optimizations with unclear value
- Features that may never be needed (YAGNI principle)

CRITERIA FOR "OVERENGINEERING CONCERN":
- Adds complexity without clear business value
- Premature optimization
- Over-abstraction for current use case
- Violates KISS principle

ALWAYS APPLY: Question if each suggestion truly improves the solution or adds unnecessary complexity

PR REVIEW COMMENT FORMATTING:
Each review comment should clearly indicate the recommended action:

CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix before merge):
```
⚠️ **BLOCKING**: Missing issue linkage
**Action Required**: Add "Fixes #XX" to PR description before merging
**Rationale**: Required for traceability
```

FOLLOW-UP SUGGESTIONS (Optional future work):
```
📋 **FOLLOW-UP**: Consider adding input validation
**Suggestion**: Could create follow-up issue for enhanced error handling
**Check**: Issue #XX already covers this - see [link]
**Value**: Medium - improves user experience but not blocking
```

NICE-TO-HAVE (Likely ignore):
```
💡 **CONSIDER**: Extract helper function
**Assessment**: Minor optimization, YAGNI applies
**Action**: No action needed unless part of larger refactor
```

OVERENGINEERING CONCERNS (Reject):
```
❌ **COMPLEXITY**: Abstract factory pattern suggested
**Concern**: Adds unnecessary complexity for current use case
**Recommendation**: Keep simple implementation, revisit if requirements change
```

FOLLOW-UP ISSUE CREATION POLICY:
- Limit to 1-2 genuinely valuable suggestions per PR
- Always check if issue already exists first
- Include clear business value justification
- Avoid creating issues for subjective style preferences

FINAL PR UPDATE POLICY:
If PR changed due to review feedback, add comment before merge:
✅ Fixed: [list changes made]
📋 Follow-ups: [link issues created] 
💡 Skipped: [what ignored and why]

COMMON PR REVIEW ISSUES:
- Missing issue linkage: Add "Fixes #XX" to PR description
- Missing tests: Add appropriate test coverage
- Documentation updates: Update relevant docs
- Type errors: Fix mypy/typing issues
- Lint issues: Run formatters and fix style

PR REVIEW COMMANDS (MCP PREFERRED):
- Check comments: Use GitHub MCP server with natural language "show comments on PR 42"
- Update description: Use GitHub MCP server "update PR 42 description to <new content>"
- Merge PR: Use GitHub MCP server "merge PR 42 with squash strategy"
- View status: Use GitHub MCP server "show status of my PRs"

FALLBACK CLI COMMANDS (if MCP unavailable):
- Check comments: gh pr view 42 --json comments
- Update description: gh pr edit 42 --body "new description"
- Merge PR: gh pr merge 42 --squash --delete-branch
- View status: gh pr status

ISSUE MANAGEMENT (GITHUB MCP SERVER):

Use GitHub MCP server for comprehensive repository operations through natural language

MANDATORY LABELS:
Priority (every issue): P0 (critical), P1 (high), P2 (medium), P3 (low), P4 (trivial)
Type (every issue): bug, feature, enhancement, documentation, test, refactor, security, performance, maintenance
Area (at least one): area:pattern-detection, area:educational-content, area:case-studies, area:validation, area:cli, area:mcp-integration, area:data-management

STATUS LABELS: status:untriaged, status:needs-info, status:blocked, status:in-progress, status:review, status:testing, status:ready

VALIDATED ISSUE CREATION PATTERN:
1. VALIDATE required components: TITLE="[Type]: Description", PRIORITY, TYPE, AREA
2. VALIDATE label requirements exist
3. CREATE: Use GitHub MCP server "create issue in kesslerio/vibe-check-mcp with title '<title>' body '<body>' labels '<labels>'"

MANDATORY ISSUE BODY TEMPLATE:
## Problem Description
[Clear description]
## Solution Approach  
[Proposed solution]
## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Anti-pattern prevention validated
## Labels Applied
- Priority: [P0-P4]
- Type: [bug/feature/etc]
- Area: [area:*]

SYSTEMATIC ISSUE LIFECYCLE:
1. Research: Use GitHub MCP server "search issues in kesslerio/vibe-check-mcp for keywords"
2. Analyze: Use mcp__clear-thought-server__mentalmodel(First Principles) for complex issues
3. Create: Use GitHub MCP server with validated pattern above
4. Track: Update status through GitHub MCP server operations
5. Comment: Use GitHub MCP server for issue updates
6. Close: Include verification comment via GitHub MCP server

LABEL VALIDATION ENFORCEMENT:
Before closing ANY issue verify:
- Has Priority label (P0-P4)
- Has Type label (bug, feature, etc.)
- Has Area label (area:*)
- Has appropriate Status progression

BRANCH STRATEGY:
- NEVER work on main directly
- ALWAYS check branch: git branch --show-current
- Create feature branch: git checkout -b feature/issue-{number}-{description}
- Commit format: "Type: Description #issue-number"

DOCUMENTATION SEARCH PRIORITY:
1. PRIMARY: mcp__crawl4ai-rag__perform_rag_query(query, source?, match_count=5)
2. Check sources: mcp__crawl4ai-rag__get_available_sources()
3. SECONDARY: mcp__crawl4ai-rag__crawl_single_page(url) or smart_crawl_url(url)
4. TERTIARY: Web search as last resort

Key sources: modelcontextprotocol.io, github.com/jlowin/fastmcp, Python docs

NATURAL LANGUAGE OPERATIONS:
- "Create an issue in my repo about X"
- "Show me PR #42 comments" 
- "Search for issues with label 'bug'"
- "Merge PR #42 with squash"
- "Update issue #15 description"

GITHUB MCP SERVER CAPABILITIES:
- Add comments to issues with natural language commands
- Comprehensive repository management and automation

USAGE PRIORITY:
1. Use GitHub MCP server for all GitHub operations through natural language
2. Fall back to CLI only when MCP unavailable
3. Always prefer GitHub MCP server's comprehensive functionality
