   - Main test file with 17 comprehensive security tests
   - Covers all CRITICAL, HIGH, and MEDIUM vulnerabilities
   - Includes integration tests and fixture-based tests

2. **`SECURITY_REGRESSION_TEST_SUMMARY.md`**
   - Detailed documentation of test coverage
   - Execution instructions
   - Expected behavior documentation

10. Verbose Error Messages - `test_verbose_error_messages_sanitization`
11. Missing Authentication - `test_authentication_requirement`
12. Cache Poisoning - `test_cache_poisoning_prevention`

### ✅ INTEGRATION (5 additional tests)
- Complete security pipeline test
- Security patches auto-application test
- Security monitoring and logging test
- Workspace isolation test
- Symlink attack prevention test

## Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 17
- **Vulnerabilities Covered**: 12/12 (100%)
- **Test Categories**: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, INTEGRATION
- **Test Types**: Unit, Integration, Fixture-based

## How to Run

### Run all security regression tests:
```bash
pytest tests/security/test_security_regression.py -v
```

### Run specific severity level:
```bash
pytest tests/security/test_security_regression.py -m critical -v
pytest tests/security/test_security_regression.py -m high -v
pytest tests/security/test_security_regression.py -m medium -v
```

### Run with coverage:
```bash
pytest tests/security/test_security_regression.py --cov=src/vibe_check/mentor --cov-report=html
```

## Test Design Features

### 1. Comprehensive Attack Vectors
- Real-world injection payloads
- Multiple encoding techniques
- Combined attack scenarios
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

### 2. Positive and Negative Testing
- Tests both attack prevention (negative)
- Tests legitimate operations still work (positive)
- Validates security doesn't break functionality

### 3. Clear Documentation
- Each test documents the specific vulnerability
- References line numbers from PR #190 report
- Explains expected behavior with/without patches

### 4. Async Support
- Proper async/await for async operations
- Uses pytest-asyncio for async test support
- Mock objects configured for async testing

### 5. Fixture-based Testing
- `mock_secure_environment` fixture for isolated testing
- Temporary directories for file system tests
- Clean test isolation

## Expected Test Behavior

### Current State (Without Full Patches)
- 4 tests passing (basic security already in place)
- 13 tests failing (awaiting security patch implementation)
- This validates tests correctly identify vulnerabilities

### Target State (With Security Patches)
- All 17 tests should pass
- Confirms all vulnerabilities are mitigated
- Validates patches don't break functionality

## Key Test Assertions

Each test includes specific assertions to verify:
1. **Attack vectors are blocked** - Malicious patterns don't appear in output
2. **Data is sanitized** - Redaction markers appear where expected
3. **Operations complete timely** - No ReDoS or resource exhaustion
4. **Legitimate use works** - Security doesn't break normal functionality
5. **Logging occurs** - Security events are properly logged

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests should be:
1. Run on every PR to prevent regression
2. Part of the main test suite
3. Required to pass before merge
4. Monitored for performance (should complete < 10s)

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Security Patches**: Apply the fixes from `mcp_sampling_patch.py`
2. **Verify Tests Pass**: Ensure all 17 tests pass with patches
3. **Add to CI Pipeline**: Include in GitHub Actions workflow
4. **Monitor Coverage**: Ensure security code has >90% test coverage
5. **Regular Updates**: Add new tests as new vulnerabilities are discovered
